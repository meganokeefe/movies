# Movies Project
Final project for CS249, Spring 2016

#### 4 goals for this project:

1. What is the relationship between box office revenue and genre? (Do some genres make more money? What about changes over time?)

2. ~~What are the most common intersections between genres?~~

(Complete. Created a Genre Explorer with weighted labels. See genre_intersections.py)
The explorer is at [cs.wellesley.edu/mokeefe2/cs249/genres]()

3. ** Gender representation in film:** What is the average age of the male/female lead over time? What is the ratio between male/female actors across different genres? 

4. **Basic text analysis of plot summaries:** which phrases are more likely to produce a top-grossing film?
