#### Four key areas of analysis:

* What is the relationship between box office revenue and genre? (Do some genres make more money? What about changes over time?)

* What are the most common intersections between genres?

* ** Gender representation in film:** What is the average age of the male/female lead over time? What is the ratio between male/female actors across different genres? 

* **Text analysis of plot summaries:** which phrases are more likely to produce a top-grossing film?
